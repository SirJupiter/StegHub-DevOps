# LEMP Stack

**LEMP** is an acronym that stands for Linux, Nginx, MySQL, and PHP. It's a popular open-source software stack commonly used for building and deploying web applications.

## Components of the LEMP

1. **Linux:** This is the operating system that forms the foundation of the stack. It provides a stable and secure environment for the other components to run.
2. **Nginx:** A high-performance web server responsible for handling incoming requests and delivering web content. It's known for its speed, efficiency, and ability to handle a large number of concurrent connections.
3. **MySQL:** A relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store and retrieve data for your web application. MySQL is popular due to its reliability, performance, and ease of use.
4. **PHP:** A popular programming language used to create dynamic web content. PHP scripts interact with the web server, database, and other components to generate HTML pages.

## How the LEMP Stack Works Together

1. **User Request:** A user types a URL into their web browser.
2. **Nginx Receives Request:** The web browser sends the request to your web server (Nginx).
3. **Nginx Processes Request:** Nginx processes the request, determines the appropriate PHP script to handle it, and passes the request to the PHP engine.
4. **PHP Script Execution:** The PHP script runs, fetching data from the MySQL database, processing it, and generating HTML content.
5. **Nginx Sends Response:** Nginx receives the generated HTML content from PHP and sends it back to the user's web browser.
6. **Browser Renders Content:** The user's web browser displays the HTML content, creating the web page.

In essence, the LEMP stack works together to handle web requests, process data, and generate dynamic web content.
